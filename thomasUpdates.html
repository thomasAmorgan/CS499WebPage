    <!-- PUT YOUR WEEKLY UPDATES IN HERE -->

      <h1>Week 1: 2/4 - 2/10</h1>
      <p>This week focused on learning the game that we are going to recreate. We played the physical version of the game with Mr. Elam in order to better understand how the game is actually played. Even though we were given the rule book on how to play it became much clearer on how the game works by playing it. We were able to get a better understanding on how to approach recreating the game for a web based version. I also created our project website using HTML and Bootstrap 4 for the CSS. We plan on updating the site to have more up to date and clear information about how we are going to approach implementing the game.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h1>Week 1: 2/11 - 2/17</h1>
      <p>This week focused on figuring out path for development. We had a meeting to fix the general requirements section of our website and another meeting to finish the requirements page. The last meeting was especially useful as we determined what platform and development tools we would be using to create our product. We were also able to flesh out what roles each of us would have in the development process. I, along with Sam, will mainly be working on the UI and graphical elements of the game such as the board and the pieces. The rest of the group will be handling the "backend" i.e. the scripting that will be used for actual game play.</p>
