    <!-- PUT YOUR WEEKLY UPDATES IN HERE -->
    <div class="container">
      <h1>Week 1: 2/4 - 2/10</h1>
      <p>This week focused on learning the game that we are going to recreate. We played the physical version of the game with Mr. Elam in order to better understand how the game is actually played. Even though we were given the rule book on how to play it became much clearer on how the game works by playing it. We were able to get a better understanding on how to approach recreating the game for a web based version. I also created our project website using HTML and Bootstrap 4 for the CSS. We plan on updating the site to have more up to date and clear information about how we are going to approach implementing the game.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h1>Week 2: 2/11 - 2/17</h1>
      <p>This week focused on figuring out path for development. We had a meeting to fix the general requirements section of our website and another meeting to finish the requirements page. The last meeting was especially useful as we determined what platform and development tools we would be using to create our product. We were also able to flesh out what roles each of us would have in the development process. I, along with Sam, will mainly be working on the UI and graphical elements of the game such as the board and the pieces. The rest of the group will be handling the "backend" i.e. the scripting that will be used for actual game play.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h1>Week 3: 2/25 - 3/3</h1>
      <p>This week focused on realigning our development efforts. While creating the UI for the website I hit a snag when it came to making the hexmap for the game board. It was a lot more difficult to do than initially thought. So I decided it would be best if we all concentrated our efforts to solving this problem. I found a git repository called Honeycomb (open sourced) that will most likely help us solve this problem. Hoping to make good progress on it this week. I was able to create a basic UI for the game using Bootstrap 4. We also discussed and started working on our midterm presentation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h1>Week 4: 3/4 - 3/10</h1>
      <p>This week focused on the getting our hexmap up and running. We were able to get a working version of the map up and running with the ability to place grids and a highlighting feature when the mouse hovers over the board. This is an awesome start and we should be able to improve upon the map and add more functionality this coming week. We also prepared for our midterm presentation, we created and practiced our presentation and plan on going over it again next week. Overall I think we are making good progress.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h1>Week 5: 3/18 - 3/24</h1>
      <p>This week focused on updating our hexmap to add more functionality to it. I specifically worked on making a start page that will appear when the player first starts the game. It's a work in progress, it will follow the mockup shown on the design section. Hope to have it done by the end of next week. We plan on meeting soon to discuss how we are going to go about the testing section for the game. We will also likely discuss the final stages for our project and how we are going to wrap up our project for the semester and make it workable for the next group.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h1>Week 6: 3/25 - 4/1</h1>
      <p>This week focused on planning our testing methods. We went through scenarios and decided the best course of action for testing our game. Since we have updated more to the grid (rotation, moving, swapping, and enhanced the highlighting feature) we had to decide how to test it to make sure it works as intended. We're gearing up for the final presentation and also adding the finishing touches so that we can leave a good foundation for the next team.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h1>Week 7: 4/2 - 4/8</h1>
      <p>This week focused on testing our game based on the testing specifications we outlined. We also updated some of the test cases to be easier and more readable. We also finalized our code to be ready for the code review on Friday. </p>
