          <h4>What We Learned</h4>
          <p>
            We learned the importance of planning accordingly. We definitely overestimated how much work we would get done during the semester. We assumed that we would have a fully functional game by the end of the semester, but we quickly ran into some difficulties in implementation. We also learned how important it is to communicate with one another, in order to get real work done.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>What We Would Do Differently</h4>
          <p>
            We would absolutely plan more realistically. And work harder to make the code we do create to be as solid as possible since it's more important to have solid code base than one that is essentially spaghetti. Not that our code was spaghetti, but if we had gone in with mind set that we would get everything done we could have focused our efforts more efficiently.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Customer Impressions</h4>
          <p>
            Our customer, Tony Elam, was very satisfied with what we produced. Mainly because we had a basic working hex grid and because the code was well documented. He had a problem with another team where the code they received was neither well documented nor compartmentalized (i.e. functions) which made it impossible for that team to do the work they needed to, instead they had to refactor the code base.
